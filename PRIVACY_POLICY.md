# Privacy Policy
**App Name:** Protein Stock Watch  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Policy Version:** 1.0

Protein Stock Watch ("the App") helps users monitor availability status of selected protein-related products (including Amul-branded products) based on a manually entered pincode. This document explains what data we do and do not collect and how user information is handled.

## 1. Scope
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Protein Stock Watch Android application. It does not cover any external websites or services you may visit from outside the App.

## 2. Summary (Plain Language)
- We do **not** collect, transmit, sell, rent, or share personal data.
- We do **not** use analytics, tracking SDKs, ad networks, crash reporting services, or profiling tools.
- All entered data (pincode + selected products) stays **locally on your device**.
- Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data.

## 3. Data We Collect
**No personal or sensitive user data is collected.**

### 3.1 Locally Stored (On Device Only)
| Data Item | Purpose | Stored Where | Shared? |
|-----------|---------|--------------|---------|
| Pincode (6-digit) | Determine regional product availability logic | Android SharedPreferences | No |
| Selected Product IDs / Names | Determine which products to monitor | Android SharedPreferences | No |

This data never leaves your device; it is not uploaded to any server we control.

## 4. Data We Do NOT Collect
We do **not** collect:
- Names, email addresses, phone numbers
- Precise GPS location (pincode is user-entered, not GPS-derived)
- Contacts, calendar, SMS, call logs
- Payment or financial info
- Health or fitness data
- Device advertising identifiers
- Usage analytics or behavioral metrics

## 5. Network Communication
Current version uses a **static product list** and does not fetch remote data from proprietary servers. Standard Android / Google system services may make background network calls unrelated to our logic (e.g., Play Services), which are governed by their own policies.

## 6. Permissions
The App does **not** request dangerous or sensitive Android permissions (e.g., location, contacts, storage). Standard minimal permissions required for normal app operation (e.g., internet for potential future expansion) may be declared, but no personal data is extracted.

## 7. Third-Party Services & SDKs
The App does **not** embed third-party analytics, ads SDKs, or crash reporting tools at this time. If this changes in a future release, this policy will be updated before such a version goes live.

## 8. Advertising
The App currently serves **no advertisements** and performs no ad tracking.

## 9. Children’s Privacy
The App is intended for general users (adults managing product availability). It is **not directed to children under 13** and does not collect data knowingly from minors. If you believe a minor has provided data inadvertently, uninstalling the App removes stored selections.

## 10. Security
Because all user-entered data stays locally on the device, exposure risk is limited to device-level compromise. We recommend standard device security practices (screen lock, OS updates). We do not transmit or store your data on external servers.

## 11. Data Retention & Deletion
- Data persists only as long as the App remains installed.
- Uninstalling the App deletes all locally stored preferences (pincode and selections).
- Reinstalling starts with a clean state.

## 12. International Transfers
No international transfer occurs because no user data is sent off the device.

## 13. Policy Changes
We may update this policy for accuracy, feature changes, or legal compliance. The “Effective Date” will be revised. Material changes (e.g., introducing analytics or remote sync) will be highlighted in release notes and an in-app notice, if implemented.

## 14. Contact
For privacy questions or feedback:
- **Email:** aakashsheth@outlook.com  
(Replace with your actual support email before publishing.)

## 15. Trademark Disclaimer
“Amul” and any product names referenced are trademarks of their respective owners. Protein Stock Watch is an independent tool and is **not** affiliated with or endorsed by Amul or any associated brand owners.

## 16. User Responsibility
By using the App, you acknowledge this policy and agree not to misuse the application. If you disagree, please discontinue use and uninstall.

**No Data Collected. No Tracking. Local Only.**

If you introduce remote APIs or analytics later, add a new section detailing: data categories, purpose, retention, user opt-out, and update your Play Store Data Safety form accordingly.
